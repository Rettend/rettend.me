In most areas the best companies are the ones that are more vertically
integrated. SpaceX vs ULA, Tesla vs GM.

You might think Vercel is a vertically integrated company.
But don't be fooled by their aesthetic.

Not all vertical integrating companies are equal,
what actually matters is how deep you integrated _down_.

| Integrated Down | Integrated Up |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Cloudflare      | Vercel        |
| Discord         | Slack         |
| Starlink        | AT&T          |
| Google/xAI      | OpenAI        |
