## Welcome

This is the first post on my blog. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences here.

### What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development**: Deep dives into modern web technologies
- **Performance**: Making the web faster for everyone
- **SolidJS & Astro**: My favorite frameworks
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **UI/UX**: Building beautiful, accessible interfaces

### Code Examples

Here's a simple example in TypeScript:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`
}
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}
```

### Why This Blog?

I believe in sharing knowledge and learning in public. This blog is a space for me to:

1. Document my learning journey
2. Share solutions to problems I've encountered
3. Contribute to the web development community

> "The best way to learn is to teach."

### Stay Tuned
